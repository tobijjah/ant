# ant
Agent based modelling on example of ant colony optimization.

## Features
- Very inefficient drawing (I would not increase the number of agents over 1000 except you like a flip-books)
- State of the art 2D-graphics with colored squares and circles
- Context sensitive interface (no annoying overlays to fully enjoy the moving squares)

## Installation

## Example

## Goals
- Implement an agent-based model base on the ant colony optimization algorithm
- Train code documentation
- Train create a consistent design
- Train UML class diagrams
- Train testing with > 90% coverage (mocking and other fancy shit)
- Train python typing module

## ToDo
-[x] setup.py
-[x] sphinx cfg
-[x] makefile
-[ ] environment
    -[x] doc Cell and Position
    -[ ] logging Environment, Cell, and Position
    -[ ] tests Environment, Cell, and Position
-[ ] agents
